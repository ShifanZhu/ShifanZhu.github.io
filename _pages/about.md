I am a Ph.D. stduent in the Dynamic and Autonomous Robotics Systems Lab at the University of Massachusetts Amherst advised by [Donghyun Kim](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/kim-donghyun). My research focuses on event camera-based <a style='color:#B509AC;'>perception</a>, <a style='color:#B509AC;'>state estimation</a>, and <a style='color:#B509AC;'>navigation</a>:
    
  -- <a style='color:#B509AC;'><b>State estimation in challenging conditions.</b></a> Developing robust state estimatio based on multi-sensors, including event camera, IMU, RGB-D cameera, etc., enabling accurate and robust pose estimation for robots.

  -- <a style='color:#B509AC;'><b>Navigation in complex environments.</b></a> Developing navigation system that enables robot traverse complex terriens.
